Due to a team member being out of town over the first weekend, and then Fall Break, we will not have made much progress by the end of Week 1. We met with Dr. Parnin after receiving feedback on our Design portion, and based on that feedback, we decided to go in a completely new direction for our Bot. This has caused us to fall behind schedule, and so we will not be able to due one use case a week, but will need to do 2 use cases in the second week to get back on track. Our only true "Deliverable" for Week 1 will be making progress on [FIXDESIGN.md](https://github.ncsu.edu/gmmack/BuildSlackers/blob/master/FIXDESIGN.md), so we can resubmit it, and move forward with our Bot.
